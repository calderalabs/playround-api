risk:
  name: Risk!
  description: "Risk is a strategic board game, produced by Parker Brothers (now a division of Hasbro).
  It was invented by French film director Albert Lamorisse and originally released in 1957, as La ConquÃªte du Monde (\"The Conquest of the World\"), in France.
  Risk is a turn-based game for two to six players. The standard version is played on a board depicting a political map of the Earth, divided into forty-two territories, which are grouped into six continents.
  The primary object of the game is \"world domination\", or \"to occupy every territory on the board and in so doing, eliminate all other players.\"
  Players control armies with which they attempt to capture territories from other players, with results determined by dice rolls."
